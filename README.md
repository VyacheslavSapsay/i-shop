# E-commerce Website

This is a full-fledged e-commerce website built with Rails, featuring complete functionality for managing products, shopping cart, and order processing.

## Project Goal
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate a fully functional e-commerce platform, allowing users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and place orders.

## Key Features
- **Product Management**: Ability to add and manage products.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to their cart and proceed to checkout.
- **Order Processing**: Complete functionality for placing orders and managing the checkout process.

## Notes
This is my only second serious Rails project within my learning journey of the framework. While there are areas in the code and architecture that could benefit from refactoring, the project serves as an example of a comprehensive, fully functional, and working open-source e-commerce solution.
